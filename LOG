1/13/2019 design 3d part for eye piece which holds camera - JS

1/16/2019 printed 3d part, put together battery circuit, on/off/switch, and wires for buttons.

need to program GPIO buttons, solder on/offswitch, start pupil tracking.

Began implementation of circular hough transform (CHT) to track the center of the pupil. - NP

Created a module named simplecam.py that would print my webcam feed and draw the hough
circles on the video feed.  The module needs better biasing, it is detecting far too many circles
that are not the pupil. This might not be a problem when the camera is right on the eye, 
need to test on the raspi. - NP
