1/13/2019 design 3d part for eye piece which holds camera - JS

1/16/2019 printed 3d part, put together battery circuit, on/off/switch, and wires for buttons.

need to program GPIO buttons, solder on/offswitch, start pupil tracking.

Began implementation of circular hough transform (CHT) to track the center of the pupil. - NP

Created a module named simplecam.py that would print my webcam feed and draw the hough
circles on the video feed.  The module needs better biasing, it is detecting far too many circles
that are not the pupil. This might not be a problem when the camera is right on the eye, 
need to test on the raspi. - NP

1/17/19 wroked on filters for pupil detection algorithm - NP

2/16/19 - Finished pupil detection script simplecam.py  that displays the camera feed with
circles drawn on the pupils and also prints the locations of the center of the puils.  Works about 90% of the time at least.  More information in readme

2/21/19 - Implemented my algorithm in simplecam into a new python script called putrk.py
Putrk finds the center of the eye and prints it.  It also has the optional ability of
saving an image of the eye with the circle printed over the pupil for trouble shooting.
Next I need to figure out a way to use the coordiantes of the eye with the e-paper to
turn the page with the eye.  I am thinking of designating a maximum eye position and
when the eye goes past it for a certain amount of time it switches the page.
