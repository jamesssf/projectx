/////simplecam.py/////
A simple pupil tracking algorithm using cv2's HoughCircles and threshold.
This module is a test module, however many of the functions in the module are sure to end 
up in a future final version

def showcam() - Print the camera, and launch the pupildetect function.
Takes the average of 2 frames pupil to smooth detection
Prints the detected pupil location
return null

def pupildetect(img) - find the pupil with CHT
img - the captured image from the camera
Detects all the circles in the image and takes the average
Currentyl very accurate, although there are false detections
THat show up once every 2 seconds at most, usually not very frequently
return the x y and r of the circle for that frame

draw(img, x, y, r)
img - the image to be drawn on from camera
x, y, r - Circle information
Draws circles on the image

Currently medium to high accuracy, can be improved, although it might
be good to apply stochastic models to pupil detection.
